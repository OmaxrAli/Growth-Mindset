## Operators

An operator is an element of a fonction that performs some operation on **single** or **multiple** data value to give a resuilt.
and Java Script many types of operators.

### Operators Types
* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Arithmetic operators
* Bitwise operators
* Logical operators
* String operators
* Conditional (ternary) operator
* Comma operator
* Unary operators
* Relational operators

## Expressions
An Expressions is a peace of code that resolves to a value.

JavaScript has the following expression categories:

Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example 3.14159. (Generally uses arithmetic operators.)
String: evaluates to a character string, for example, "Fred" or "234". (Generally uses string operators.)
Logical: evaluates to true or false. (Often involves logical operators.)
Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.
Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the destination of an assignment.

## Functions
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task and executed when it's called.

### JavaScript Function Syntax
**(function)** is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ()
the parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
and we use its name to call it.

Inside the function, the arguments **(the parameters)** behave as local variables.
### Function Invocation
As a peace of code we use the name of the function with adding values to it when its needed and 
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)

When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code

Automatically (self invoked)

### Why do we use functions?

that is to write the code once and use it many times saving time and effort.
