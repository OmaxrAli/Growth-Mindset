## Operators

An operator is an element of a fonction that performs some operation on **single** or **multiple** data value to give a resuilt.
and Java Script many types of operators.

### Operators Types
* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Arithmetic operators
* Bitwise operators
* Logical operators
* String operators
* Conditional (ternary) operator
* Comma operator
* Unary operators
* Relational operators

|Operator |	Example |	Same As
| ------ | ------ | --------
|=	| x = y | 	x = y
|+=	x | += y |	x = x + y
|-=	x | -= y |	x = x - y
|*=	x | *= y |	x = x * y
|/=	x | /= y |	x = x / y
|%=	x | %= y |	x = x % y
|**= |	x **= y |	x = x ** y

## Loops

Instead of writing the code multiple times we use the loops to reduce the time and efforst Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.
### Loop types in JavaScript
