## What is Wireframe?
At the start of any project instead of working through to test the final design and show it to the client we use a wireframe and the wireframe is the skeleton of any digital product or the pages of it containing the details of that product, so it is just a piece of paper that makes the user interacts with the interface and the product by affording the planning and the final deigns of the product.

## Why do we use?


Saves money and time
Doesnâ€™t require many materials to make them
Reviewing the product before start working on it


## The process of a wireframe 


1. The mane goal
2. Listing the requirements
3. Sketching   
4. Delivering

## HTML

**HTML** is a markup language that websites use to contain their content it's basically just a document that your browser can open which will then display a webpage every website uses **HTML** but they use it in different ways even a complex web app like ***google docs*** uses html although it also uses other code like ***Javascript*** so anytime you visit a website in your browser know that html is playing an important role.
